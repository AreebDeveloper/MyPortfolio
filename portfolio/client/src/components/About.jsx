                Hi there! I'm Areeb, a full-stack web developer from Pakistan with a passion for creating
                clean, efficient, and beautiful web applications.
              </p>
  
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                My journey in web development began when I was 14, and I've been constantly learning and improving my
                skills ever since. I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of elegant design and efficient code.
              </p>
  
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and have a keen eye for detail when
                it comes to user experience and interface design. I believe that great software should not only function
                flawlessly but also look and feel amazing to use.
              </p>
  
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or
                sketching UI designs for future projects. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations!
